# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Allows users to have a visual representation of how various sorting algorithms work.
Currently, only bubble sort is supported, but more sorting algorithms will be added in
the future.

# Features ‚ú®
- Responsive design üì±
- Utilized HTML/CSS/JavaScript üñ•Ô∏è

# How to Run üöÄ
1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/wong-bria/sorting-visualizer.git
2. Open 'index.html' in your browser

# Example Usage
Users can click the "Randomize Array" button to generate a randomized array:
![result_from_randomize_array](images/result_from_randomize_array.png)

Users can click the "Sort" button to sort the randomized array to visualize how
bubble sort works to sort an unsorted array:
![result_from_sort](images/result_from_sort.png)

# Motivation behind project: 
After taking a class on Algorithms and Data, and wanting to learn/practice using JavaScript,
I decided to start this personal project to apply the information I learned while learning more
about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
